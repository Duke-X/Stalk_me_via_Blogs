### Love the Loop

Summer holidays have finally started, and the grind has been going great so far. I finally began learning a new data structure, Linked List, which I was initially afraid of, but it turned out to be quite simple. My summer training is also going well; I'm learning about SQL commands, the PL/SQL language, and a bit about Form Builder and Report Builder. It feels like I'm in a loop that I don't want to escape because I'm enjoying it so much.

Here's what my daily routine looks like: I wake up around 7 am, freshen up, eat breakfast, then get ready for training and leave the house by 8:30. I reach the office by 9 am, mark my attendance, and head straight to my desk. I spend my time at the office learning new things related to Oracle, then leave around 1 pm. I get home, have lunch, and take a short rest for half an hour.

After my power nap, the real hustle begins. I spend about 2 to 3 hours learning DevOps basics. Some days I focus on React, and other days on DevOps. It's been really fun. To clear my mind, I take a break and go to the gym for a workout that lasts about 1 to 2 hours. After coming back, I have my diet meal, which is necessary to avoid feeling lethargic.

After resting and having dinner, I start my hustle again by learning DSA from 'Striver' and 'Love Babbar'. I study until 1 am, then get the best sleep I've ever had.  
*Next morning, the grind starts, and the hustle continues!*
