### Reality Hits

Finally my college started today. I'm in my 3rd year, soon the placement season will arrive, companies will start coming, and I won't get placed? This thing has been scaring me a lot, whether I'll get placed or not, and this eats me alive, if I don't get placed how will I be able to make my parents proud. Do DSA! DSA is the only key to get placed! DSA this DSA that...

Seriously, I was quite motivated during my vacations, I was working hard at that time, but now I think I've lost the grip. But today in my Software Engineering lecture, my Academic Coordinator came. He was the subject teacher actually, who has also worked in Accenture before. He just started showing us the reality, & told discipline is the key! Gave us some examples of his previous students who got placed. He motivated us, gave us hope, and showed us the reality of a software engineer life, how it feels when you start earning. It really pumped me up.

I know DSA has been a pain in the ass, but I have to do it. It's a DO or DIE situation. From now onwards, I'm going to bring back that old energy, will make sure that I don't get distracted. I've only got 6 months with me, I think that has to be enough to complete DSA & revise it simultaneously.

Pray for me. Luck, stay with me!
