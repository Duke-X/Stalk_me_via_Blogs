### First Language

Living among seniors in my hostel, I saw them practicing DSA questions daily. They told me it's the key to landing a job with a good salary. Following their advice, I decided to choose a programming language. Since my college started teaching me C in my first year, I decided to explore it further and eventually chose C++ as my first language.

I began learning the basics from a popular YouTube channel, 'CodeHelp' by Love Babbar. His playlist, which covers a comprehensive DSA course, is excellent and clears up all the basics. I started learning from there, but I wasn't disciplined and took long breaks in between, which broke my consistency and caused me to forget the concepts. This was my schedule for the entire first year.

Sometimes, when I found DSA difficult, I explored other tech fields, which wasted a lot of my time, although I did learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, running away from DSA wasn't the solution; embracing it was. The first year went by with me learning the basics of the C++ language and starting with my very first data structure, Arrays.
