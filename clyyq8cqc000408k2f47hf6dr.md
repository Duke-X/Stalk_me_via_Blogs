### Anxious Me

It's been really hard for me, it's so hot here in India. Right now I'm living in a hostel, where I can't explain how the ducts work. Whenever it feels like giving cold breeze it does, mostly it just throws plain air at us. I feel like I'll melt away. Furthermore, it's really difficult to study in this type of environment. My mood recently has been going up & down just like the bets in the Stake.

I'm feeling down somehow, thinking of future and how I won't get a job. I'm stuck. Feeling guilty & helpless. Feel like I'm somewhere I don't belong, I can't even get a code run by using simple logic. I'm just watching video tutorials, understanding the code, writing it, and then moving forward. After sometime I know I'll definitely forget it. I think my mind is not logical enough, I've been saying this to myself for quite a long time. May be it's time to use reverse function hahaha, reverse psychology I meant.

As I was down for a few days, my room mates and my friends helped me out. It's time to change my statement and that is I can code, I can build the logic, I'll crack my dream company!

Let's hope for the best....Keep Grinding!
